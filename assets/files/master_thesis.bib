	abstract = {Digital dietary assessment devices could help overcome the limitations of traditional tools to assess dietary intake in clinical and/or epidemiological studies. We evaluated the accuracy of the automated dietary app {MyFoodRepo} ({MFR}) against controlled reference values from weighted food diaries ({WFD}). {MFR}’s capability to identify, classify and analyze the content of 189 different records was assessed using Cohen and uniform kappa coefficients and linear regressions. {MFR} identified 98.0\% ± 1.5 of all edible components and was not affected by increasing numbers of ingredients. Linear regression analysis showed wide limits of agreement between {MFR} and {WFD} methods to estimate energy, carbohydrates, fat, proteins, fiber and alcohol contents of all records and a constant overestimation of proteins, likely reflecting the overestimation of portion sizes for meat, fish and seafood. The {MFR} mean portion size error was 9.2\% ± 48.1 with individual errors ranging between −88.5\% and +242.5\% compared to true values. Beverages were impacted by the app’s difficulty in correctly identifying the nature of liquids (41.9\% ± 17.7 of composed beverages correctly classified). Fair estimations of portion size by {MFR}, along with its strong segmentation and classification capabilities, resulted in a generally good agreement between {MFR} and {WFD} which would be suited for the identification of dietary patterns, eating habits and regime types.},

Control their instantiation (for example, hiding the constructors of a class)
The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.},

	abstract = {The Big Five personality traits, sometimes known as "the five-factor model of personality" or "{OCEAN} model", are a grouping of five unique characteristics used to study personality. 
It was first developed in the 1980s in the field of psychological trait theory. In the 1990s, the theory identified five factors, which may each be further divided into two distinct values:

openness to experience (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious)
conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless)
extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)
agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs. critical/judgmental)
neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)
When factor analysis is applied to personality survey data, semantic associations between aspects of personality and specific terms are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as "always prepared" rather than "messy". These associations suggest five broad dimensions used in common language to describe the human personality, temperament, and psyche.
Those labels for the five factors may be remembered using the acronyms "{OCEAN}" or "{CANOE}". Beneath each proposed global factor, there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors. For example, extraversion is typically associated with qualities such as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement-seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions. These traits are not black and white; each one is treated as a spectrum.},

	abstract = {A chi-squared test (also chi-square or χ2 test) is a statistical hypothesis test used in the analysis of contingency tables when the sample sizes are large. In simpler terms, this test is primarily used to examine whether two categorical variables (two dimensions of the contingency table) are independent in influencing the test statistic (values within the table). The test is valid when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis, specifically Pearson's chi-squared test and variants thereof. Pearson's chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a contingency table. For contingency tables with smaller sample sizes, a Fisher's exact test is used instead. 
In the standard applications of this test, the observations are classified into mutually exclusive classes. If the null hypothesis that there are no differences between the classes in the population is true, the test statistic computed from the observations follows a χ2 frequency distribution. The purpose of the test is to evaluate how likely the observed frequencies would be assuming the null hypothesis is true.
Test statistics that follow a χ2 distribution occur when the observations are independent. There are also χ2 tests for testing the null hypothesis of independence of a pair of random variables based on observations of the pairs.
Chi-squared tests often refers to tests for which the distribution of the test statistic approaches the χ2 distribution asymptotically, meaning that the sampling distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) of the test statistic approximates a chi-squared distribution more and more closely as sample sizes increase.},

	abstract = {A Likert scale ( {LIK}-ərt,) is a psychometric scale named after its inventor, American social psychologist Rensis Likert, which is commonly used in research questionnaires.  It is the most widely used approach to scaling responses in survey research, such that the term (or more fully the Likert-type scale) is often used interchangeably with rating scale, although there are other types of rating scales.
Likert distinguished between a scale proper, which emerges from collective responses to a set of items (usually eight or more), and the format in which responses are scored along a range. Technically speaking, a Likert scale refers only to the former. The difference between these two concepts has to do with the distinction Likert made between the underlying phenomenon being investigated and the means of capturing variation that points to the underlying phenomenon.
When responding to a Likert item, respondents specify their level of agreement or disagreement on a symmetric agree-disagree scale for a series of statements. Thus, the range captures the intensity of their feelings for a given item.
A scale can be created as the simple sum or average of questionnaire responses over the set of individual items (questions). In so doing, Likert scaling assumes distances between each choice (answer option) are equal. Many researchers employ a set of such items that are highly correlated (that show high internal consistency) but also that together will capture the full domain under study (which requires less-than perfect correlations). Others hold to a standard by which "All items are assumed to be replications of each other or in other words items are considered to be parallel instruments".: 197  By contrast, modern test theory treats the difficulty of each item (the {ICCs}) as information to be incorporated in scaling items.},

Based on language models, {LLMs} acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from vast amounts of text during a computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training process. {LLMs} can be used for text generation, a form of generative {AI}, by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word.
{LLMs} are artificial neural networks that utilize the transformer architecture, invented in 2017. The largest and most capable {LLMs}, as of June 2024, are built with a decoder-only transformer-based architecture, which enables efficient processing and generation of large-scale text data.
Historically, up to 2020, fine-tuning was the primary method used to adapt a model for specific tasks. However, larger models such as {GPT}-3 have demonstrated the ability to achieve similar results through prompt engineering, which involves crafting specific input prompts to guide the model's responses. These models acquire knowledge about syntax, semantics, and ontologies inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained on.
Some notable {LLMs} are {OpenAI}'s {GPT} series of models (e.g., {GPT}-3.5 and {GPT}-4, used in {ChatGPT} and Microsoft Copilot), Google's Gemini (the latter of which is currently used in the chatbot of the same name), Meta's {LLaMA} family of models, Anthropic's Claude models, and Mistral {AI}'s models.},

	abstract = {Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure ({HTTPS}) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ({HTTP}). It uses encryption for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In {HTTPS}, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security ({TLS}) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer ({SSL}). The protocol is therefore also referred to as {HTTP} over {TLS}, or {HTTP} over {SSL}.
The principal motivations for {HTTPS} are authentication of the accessed website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while it is in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional block cipher encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering. The authentication aspect of {HTTPS} requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital certificates. This was historically an expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated {HTTPS} connections were usually found only on secured payment transaction services and other secured corporate information systems on the World Wide Web. In 2016, a campaign by the Electronic Frontier Foundation with the support of web browser developers led to the protocol becoming more prevalent. {HTTPS} is now used more often by web users than the original, non-secure {HTTP}, primarily to protect page authenticity on all types of websites, secure accounts, and keep user communications, identity, and web browsing private.},

              N 
               = 215) of a questionnaire to measure individual susceptibility to different social influence strategies. To evaluate the external validity of this Susceptibility to Persuasion Scale ({STPS}) we set up a two week text-messaging intervention that used text messages implementing social influence strategies as prompts to reduce snacking behavior. In this experiment ( 
              N 
               = 73) we show that messages that are personalized (tailored) to the individual based on their scores on the {STPS}, lead to a higher decrease in snacking consumption than randomized messages or messages that are not tailored (contra-tailored) to the individual. We discuss the importance of this finding for the design of persuasive systems and detail how designers can use tailoring at the level of social influence strategies to increase the effects of their persuasive technologies.},

	abstract = {Personalized technologies aim to enhance user experience by taking into account users’ interests, preferences, and other relevant information. Persuasive technologies aim to modify user attitudes, intentions, or behavior through computer-human dialogue and social influence. While both personalized and persuasive technologies influence user interaction and behavior, we posit that this influence could be significantly increased if the two technologies were combined to create 
              personalized and persuasive 
              systems. For example, the persuasive power of a one-size-fits-all persuasive intervention could be enhanced by considering the users being influenced and their susceptibility to the persuasion being offered. Likewise, personalized technologies could cash in on increased success, in terms of user satisfaction, revenue, and user experience, if their services used persuasive techniques. Hence, the coupling of personalization and persuasion has the potential to enhance the impact of both technologies. This new, developing area clearly offers mutual benefits to both research areas, as we illustrate in this special issue.},
