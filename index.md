## About Me

I just graduated from EPFL in computer science, with a minor in management, technology, and entrepreneurship. My goal is to combine computer science with sustainable development, particularly in fields that address the pressing issues of climate change and food systems.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive positive environmental change, and I seek to build solutions that promote sustainability and ethical development.

## Research Interests

**Software Engineering:** Mobile development, AI-driven chatbots, conversational agents, large-scale software systems (Python, Swift, Java, MySQL).

**Sustainability:** Agri-tech, data-driven farming, environmental tech, climate change mitigation strategies.

**Food Sector:** Personalized nutrition, sustainable food systems, ethical supply chains, agro-tech innovation.
