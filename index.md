## About Me

I just graduated from EPFL in computer science, with a minor in management, technology, and entrepreneurship. My goal is to combine computer science with sustainable development, particularly in fields that address the pressing issues of climate change and food systems.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive positive environmental change, and I seek to build solutions that promote sustainability and ethical development.

## Research Interests

- **Software Engineering:** I'm fascinated by mobile development and the creation of complex software systems. I've worked on projects like integrating AI-driven chatbots and conversational agents into apps, which blend user interaction with advanced computational techniques.
  
- **Sustainability:** I am dedicated to understanding the impacts of climate change and exploring ways technology can help mitigate these challenges. My work revolves around developing practical solutions to promote environmental responsibility.

- **Food Sector:** Iâ€™m deeply interested in the intricate network that sustains our global food system. I'm particularly focused on how to create a more sustainable and ethical food supply chain through technological innovation.
